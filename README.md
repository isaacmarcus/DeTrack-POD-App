# DeTrack POD App

A Flutter WebApp to help users of the DeTrack software download "Proof of Delivery" en-masse using a simple and intuitive calender UI. This app was created from the point of view of a user dealing with the issue of unavailable features that the service "DeTrack" had. "DeTrack" is a delivery management system that lets administrators manage and organize drivers to delivery and collection jobs. You can find out more at: https://www.detrack.com/  

## Getting Started

In order to use the app, one must have an API key that is linked to their account that they can then use to download their relevant PODs from.
None of the data and keys are stored so it will never have a risk of data being leaked. This can all be verified from the code itself as well.
